[JebsDepot](http://www.jebsdepot.com) is an open-source web application that enables users to share and upload in-game asset files for [Kerbal Space Program 2](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com). Our primary objective is to build a platform that empowers players to rapidly design and share assemblies and workspaces in KSP2. Our focus is on enabling cutting-edge machine learning tools in KSP2, and we are excited to share our vision with the community.

To achieve our goal of using machine learning to build in-game assets from language prompts, we are starting by providing a simple, resource-responsive UI for sharing asset files. We will then leverage the data from the community to build cutting-edge tools which utilize machine learning to interpret language prompts for the purpose of creating assets in-game. We believe this will open up a whole new realm of possibilities for the KSP2 community to innovate and create new assets. Join us in shaping the future of KSP2 and mods we can provide!
